## ⚖️ Tradeoffs

| Decision | Reason |
|---|---|
| SQLite over PostgreSQL | Faster setup and simpler deployment |
| JWT stored on client side | Simpler implementation for assignment scope |
| No drag-and-drop | Prioritized core functionality within timeline |
| Simple CSS styling | Focused on usability and responsiveness |

---

## 🏗️ Technical Decisions

- **FastAPI** — Lightweight, high-performance backend with auto-generated API docs
- **React + TypeScript** — Better maintainability and type safety on the frontend
- **React Context API** — Simple auth state management without Redux overhead
- **SQLAlchemy ORM** — Clean database operations with easy migration path to PostgreSQL
- **JWT Authentication** — Secure, stateless user sessions
